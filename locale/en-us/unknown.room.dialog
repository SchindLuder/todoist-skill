I am not sure which room you mean by {room}
I must have misunderstood something the {room} is unknown to me. 
Sorry, I do not know {room}
Where should this {room} be?
Please repeat your request as {room} is new to me
Matthias must have made a mistake as i just heard {room}
Stupid me! I understood {room}
Your pronunciation sucks. All i got was {room}
{room}? that must be an imaginary room in your castle
{room}? Come on speak cleary...
